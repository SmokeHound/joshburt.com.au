# Authentication and Authorization System

This document describes the authentication and authorization system implemented for joshburt.com.au.

## Overview

The system implements a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with three user roles, secure password requirements, JWT-based authentication, and role-based permissions across all API endpoints.

## User Roles

The system supports three distinct user roles with different permission levels:

### 1. Admin
- **Full system access**
- Can create, read, update, and delete all resources
- Can manage users (create, update roles, delete)
- Can view and manage audit logs
- Can configure system settings
- Can approve/reject orders
- Can manage products, consumables, and inventory

### 2. Manager
- **Content management and user viewing**
- Can create, read, and update most content (products, consumables, orders)
- Can view users but cannot create or delete them
- Can approve/reject orders
- Can manage inventory
- Cannot access system settings or audit logs
- Cannot modify user roles or account status

### 3. User
- **Basic read and create access**
- Can read products and consumables
- Can create orders
- Cannot view other users
- Cannot modify products or consumables
- Cannot view or manage inventory
- Cannot access admin functions

## Password Requirements

All passwords must meet the following security requirements:

- **Minimum 8 characters long**
- **At least one uppercase letter** (A-Z)
- **At least one lowercase letter** (a-z)
- **At least one number** (0-9)
- **At least one special character** (!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>)

Password validation is enforced during:
- User registration
- Password reset
- Admin user creation

## Authentication Flow

### Registration
1. User provides email, name, and password
2. System validates password strength
3. Password is hashed using bcrypt (12 rounds by default)
4. Verification token is generated
5. User account is created with `email_verified = false`
6. Verification email sent (when email service configured)

### Login
1. User provides email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. Checks account status (is_active, lockout status)
4. Generates JWT access token (7-day expiry) and refresh token (30-day expiry)
5. Returns tokens and user information

### Token Refresh
1. Client provides refresh token
2. System validates token and checks expiry
3. Generates new access and refresh tokens
4. Invalidates old refresh token

### Logout
1. Client provides refresh token
2. System deletes refresh token from database
3. Client should discard local tokens

## Authorization

### Permission System

Permissions are defined in `utils/rbac.js` for each resource and action combination:

```javascript
PERMISSIONS = {
  users: {
    create: ['admin'],
    read: ['admin', 'manager'],
    update: ['admin'],
    delete: ['admin'],
    list: ['admin', 'manager'],
    stats: ['admin', 'manager']
  },
  products: {
    create: ['admin', 'manager'],
    read: ['admin', 'manager', 'user'],
    update: ['admin', 'manager'],
    delete: ['admin'],
    list: ['admin', 'manager', 'user']
  },
  // ... more resources
}
```

### Using Authorization

#### In Function Handlers

```javascript
const { requirePermission } = require('../../utils/http');

// Require specific permission
const { user, response: authResponse } = await requirePermission(event, 'products', 'create');
if (authResponse) return authResponse;

// User is now authenticated and authorized
// Proceed with operation
```

#### In Frontend

```javascript
// Check if user has permission
import { hasPermission } from './utils/rbac';

if (hasPermission(user, 'products', 'create')) {
  // Show create button
}
```

## API Endpoints

All protected endpoints require authentication via Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

## Default Users

The system creates default users for testing and initial setup:

- **Admin**: admin@joshburt.com.au / Admin123!
- **Test User**: test@example.com / Password123!
- **Test Manager**: manager@example.com / Manager123!

**⚠️ Important**: Change these passwords in production!

## Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables:

```env
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=30d

# Password Hashing
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12

# Database
DB_TYPE=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/db

# Email (optional)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@joshburt.com.au

# OAuth (optional)
AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your-auth0-client-id
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=optional-api-audience
AUTH0_AUTO_PROVISION=true
```

## Testing

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all function tests
npm run test:functions

# Run RBAC tests specifically
node tests/functions/rbac.test.js

# Run handler tests
node tests/functions/handlers.test.js
```

### Test Coverage

- ✅ User registration with password validation
- ✅ User login with credentials
- ✅ Token refresh
- ✅ Permission checking for all roles
- ✅ Protected endpoint access control
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Role-based access to resources

## Migration from Old System

If migrating from an existing system:

1. **Update default user passwords** to meet new requirements
2. **Run password validation** on existing user passwords
3. **Assign roles** to existing users (default: 'user')
4. **Test authentication** with new system
5. **Update frontend** to use new token-based auth
6. **Remove old authentication** code

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid credentials" error
- Check email and password
- Verify account is active (`is_active = true`)
- Check if account is locked (`lockout_expires`)

### "Insufficient permissions" error
- Verify user role
- Check permission requirements for endpoint
- Ensure token is valid and not expired

### "Password does not meet requirements" error
- Password must be at least 8 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Try: `MyPassword123!`

### Token expired
- Use refresh token to get new access token
- If refresh token expired, re-login required

## Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS** in production
2. **Store tokens securely** (httpOnly cookies preferred)
3. **Implement token refresh** before expiry
4. **Never log passwords** or tokens
5. **Use environment variables** for secrets
6. **Rotate JWT_SECRET** periodically
7. **Monitor failed login attempts**
8. **Implement proper logout** (clear tokens)
9. **Use role checks** in frontend UI
10. **Test permissions** thoroughly
