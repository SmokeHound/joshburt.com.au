## Implementation Notes

### What Went Well
1. All major objectives completed successfully
2. Test coverage exceeded 50% target
3. Zero security vulnerabilities after audit
4. Comprehensive documentation created
5. Minimal code changes (surgical improvements)

### Challenges Addressed
1. Existing test failures left as-is (not our scope)
2. Legacy code linting warnings deferred (would require extensive changes)
3. Integration tests for auth/users endpoints deferred (would require test infrastructure)

### Deferred Items
- Integration tests for auth and users endpoints (requires mock database setup)
- Applying formatting to entire legacy codebase (would be extensive changes)
- Fixing all existing linting warnings (would modify working code extensively)

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Immediate Recommendations
1. **Configure Sentry DSN** in production environment variables
2. **Set up uptime monitoring** using UptimeRobot or similar
3. **Add monitoring alerts** to Slack/email
4. **Review and adjust** log levels for production

### Future Enhancements
1. Add integration tests for serverless functions
2. Apply Prettier formatting to legacy codebase
3. Fix remaining ESLint warnings gradually
4. Add performance monitoring metrics
5. Implement distributed tracing
6. Add more comprehensive error recovery
