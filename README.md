## Overview
This is a modern, production-ready website for joshburt.com.au featuring a modular component architecture, comprehensive testing, responsive design with dark/light mode support, admin dashboard functionality, and a dynamic Castrol oil product ordering system. The codebase is now 100% serverless (Netlify Functions) and has been fully audited for dead code, unused variables, and debug logic.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Modular Components**: Reusable shared components for navigation, theming, and configuration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with TailwindCSS v4
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Persistent theme switching (settings stored in database, not localStorage)
- **Feature Flags**: Toggleable features (Beta Features, New Dashboard, Advanced Reports) - see [FEATURE_FLAGS.md](FEATURE_FLAGS.md)
- **Testing Suite**: Unit and integration tests with Jest
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing, linting, and deployment
- **Admin Dashboard**: User management, analytics, and site settings (fully database-driven)
- **Oil Ordering System**: Dynamic Castrol product ordering (API-driven, CSV export)
- **API Backend**: Serverless-only (Netlify Functions) with PostgreSQL / SQLite abstraction (legacy Express layer removed)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with proper ARIA attributes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Site Settings (Database-Backed)

All site settings are now stored in the database and managed via the admin dashboard. Settings are loaded and saved via the `/settings` API endpoint and changes are fully audit-logged.

### Settings Fields

-- **Branding & Contact**
	- `siteTitle`, `siteDescription`, `logoUrl`, `faviconUrl`, `contactEmail`
- **Theme**
This is a modern, production-ready website for joshburt.com.au featuring a modular component architecture, comprehensive testing, responsive design, admin dashboard functionality, and a dynamic Castrol oil product ordering system. The backend has been fully migrated to Netlify Functions (serverless) ‚Äì legacy Express server code has been removed.
- **Feature Toggles**
	- `maintenanceMode`, `enableRegistration`, `enableGuestCheckout`, `enableNewsletter`
- **API Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless) with PostgreSQL / SQLite abstraction
	- `smtpHost`, `smtpPort`, `smtpUser`, `smtpPassword`
- **Custom Code**
### Component / Serverless Structure
- **`shared-nav.html`**: Navigation sidebar with menu toggle, user profile, and navigation links
- **`shared-theme.html`**: Centralized ThemeManager - handles multi-theme support, color palettes, and system theme detection
- **`shared-config.html`**: TailwindCSS configuration and common styles
- **`netlify/functions/*`**: Serverless backend for products, orders, users, authentication, audit logs, inventory, consumables

**Theming**: Centralized ThemeManager provides multi-theme support (dark, light, system, neon, ocean, high-contrast) with custom color palettes. All theme settings are stored in the database and synchronized across tabs. See the ThemeManager API section below for details.

### Feature Flags

Three feature flags are available in the settings page to enable/disable premium features:

- **Beta Features**: Experimental features including AI-Powered Insights, Predictive Analytics, and Advanced Automation (visible in Admin Dashboard)
- **New Dashboard**: Enhanced dashboard experience with improved UI and customizable widgets (links from Admin Dashboard)
- **Advanced Reports**: Premium analytics features including Customer Lifetime Value, Churn Rate, and comprehensive report generation (visible in Analytics page)

Features are dynamically shown/hidden based on flag status. Changes take effect immediately after saving settings. See [FEATURE_FLAGS.md](FEATURE_FLAGS.md) for detailed documentation.

Demo page available at `feature-flags-demo.html` for testing.

### ThemeManager API

The centralized ThemeManager (loaded from `shared-theme.html`) provides a consistent theming system across all pages:

**Available Theme Presets:**
- `dark` - Default dark theme with blue/green/purple palette
- `light` - Light theme with same palette
- `system` - Automatically follows OS dark/light preference
- `neon` - Dark theme with cyan/neon green/magenta palette
- `ocean` - Dark theme with ocean blue palette
- `high-contrast` - Dark theme with maximum contrast colors

**JavaScript API (window.Theme):**
```javascript
// Apply theme from localStorage (called automatically on page load)
window.Theme.applyFromStorage();

// Set a theme preset
window.Theme.setTheme('neon'); // persists to localStorage by default
window.Theme.setTheme('ocean', false); // don't persist

// Set custom color palette
window.Theme.setPalette({
  primary: '#ff0000',
  secondary: '#00ff00',
  accent: '#0000ff'
});

// Get current active theme
const active = window.Theme.getActiveTheme();
// Returns: { id: 'dark', resolvedId: 'dark', mode: 'dark', colors: {...} }

// Get available presets
const presets = window.Theme.getPresets();
// Returns: ['dark', 'light', 'high-contrast', 'neon', 'ocean']
```

**Events:**
- ThemeManager listens for `siteSettingsUpdated` custom event (dispatched by settings.html after save)
- Automatically synchronizes theme changes across browser tabs via storage events
- Responds to OS theme changes when theme is set to 'system'

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Honors existing `localStorage('siteSettings')` theme and color settings
- Supports legacy `localStorage('theme')` key
- Existing inline color application scripts work alongside ThemeManager (idempotent)

### Audit Logging (Enhanced)

The audit log system now supports:

- Server-side pagination (`page`, `pageSize`) with legacy `limit` fallback
- Free-text search (`q`) across `action`, `details`, and `user_id`
- Filtering by `action`, `userId`, `startDate`, `endDate`
- CSV export (`format=csv`) and JSON export (default)
- Bulk deletion via `DELETE /.netlify/functions/audit-logs` with optional `olderThanDays=N`
- Lazy-loaded modular UI (`assets/js/audit-ui.js`) mounted only when `#audit-log-root` exists

Example:
```bash
curl '/.netlify/functions/audit-logs?page=1&pageSize=50&q=settings'
curl '/.netlify/functions/audit-logs?action=user_login&format=csv' -o login-events.csv
curl -X DELETE '/.netlify/functions/audit-logs?olderThanDays=90'
```

UI Features:
- Debounced search input
- Adjustable page size (10/25/50/100)
- Export buttons (JSON / CSV)
- Clear button (with confirmation)

See `DATABASE.md` for full parameter reference.
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

# Start static development server (serves HTML/CSS/JS only)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Netlify Functions local dev (optional, if using Netlify CLI)
# npm install -g netlify-cli
# netlify dev

# Visit http://localhost:8888 (Netlify Dev) OR http://localhost:8000 (static only)
- **`shared-config.html`**: TailwindCSS configuration and common styles
- **`API/Netlify Functions`**: Dynamic backend for products, orders, users, and authentication
### Automated Deployment
- **Netlify**: Deploys static assets + functions (primary runtime)
- **FTP Deployment**: Still available for static mirror (optional)
- **GitHub Pages**: Secondary static mirror (no dynamic features)

Serverless endpoints are accessible at:

```
/.netlify/functions/auth
/.netlify/functions/users
/.netlify/functions/orders
/.netlify/functions/products
/.netlify/functions/audit-logs
/.netlify/functions/inventory
/.netlify/functions/consumables
/.netlify/functions/consumable-categories
/.netlify/functions/public-config
```

Auth actions use a query/body `action` parameter, e.g. `/.netlify/functions/auth?action=login`.
When `AUTH0_DOMAIN` is set, Auth0 RS256 JWTs are accepted and users are auto-provisioned by default unless `AUTH0_AUTO_PROVISION=false`.
- **`consumables.html`**: Consumables order request page (for workshop staff)
- **`consumables-mgmt.html`**: Consumables product list management (admin/staff CRUD)
- Secure serverless endpoints (JWT auth, audit logging)

## üöÄ Quick Start
- Dynamic features require serverless environment (Netlify Functions). Static mirrors (GitHub Pages) will show UI but API calls fail.

## üìà Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor CI/CD pipeline health
- Update dependencies as needed
- Review and merge pull requests
- Monitor site performance and uptime
- Audit codebase for dead code, debug logic, and unused variables

### Component Updates
- All styling handled by TailwindCSS utilities
- Shared components require updates across all pages
- Test coverage ensures stability during changes

### Token & Session Hygiene
Refresh (persistent) authentication tokens are stored (hashed) in the database and expire automatically. A maintenance script is included to proactively prune any already-expired refresh tokens so the table remains small and efficient:

Run manually:
```
node scripts/prune-refresh-tokens.js
```

What it does:
- Scans the `refresh_tokens` (or equivalent) table for expired entries
- Removes them in batches (works across PostgreSQL, SQLite)
- Outputs a summary count of deleted rows

Recommended cadence:
- Ad-hoc (local dev) after heavy auth testing
- Nightly via a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (add a `schedule:` cron trigger to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` if desired)

### Serverless Function Tests
Lightweight smoke & error tests (plain Node scripts) live under `tests/functions/` and are executed in CI:
- `auth_me_smoke.test.js` ‚Äì login + /me + users listing
- `orders_products_smoke.test.js` ‚Äì products list, create order, list orders
- `auth_errors.test.js` ‚Äì invalid password, missing token, forged token cases
- `handlers.test.js` ‚Äì direct in-process invocation of function handlers (no HTTP layer) for fast feedback

Run locally (ensure dependencies installed first):
```
node tests/functions/auth_me_smoke.test.js
node tests/functions/orders_products_smoke.test.js
node tests/functions/auth_errors.test.js
node tests/functions/handlers.test.js
```

### CI Workflow
`/.github/workflows/ci.yml` performs:
1. Dependency install & CSS build
2. Direct handler tests (fast feedback without Netlify dev)
3. Starts Netlify dev (serverless runtime)
4. Executes smoke & error HTTP tests
5. Runs the refresh token prune script

Extending CI:
- Add coverage (nyc) by wrapping the handler test step
- Add a `schedule:` block for nightly hygiene (token prune, dependency audit)
- Include `npm audit --production` or `npx depcheck` for additional safety

### Environment Variables Checklist
Ensure the following are defined in Netlify (or locally in `.env`) for full functionality:
- `DB_TYPE` (postgres | sqlite)
- `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` (if not sqlite)
- `JWT_SECRET` (required for auth)
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` (optional; enables OAuth; buttons auto-enable via `/.netlify/functions/public-config`)
- Optional: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` (email flows)

### Operational Tips
- If switching database engines, clear or migrate the existing schema before first request so automatic table creation runs cleanly.
- Use SQLite locally for quickest iteration, then confirm against PostgreSQL in CI or a staging branch.
- Re-run the prune script after bulk auth / load testing to keep token tables lean.

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Development Environment
- CDN resources may be blocked in restricted environments
- Placeholder images may not load if external requests are blocked
- API/serverless/database features require supported environment and credentials

### Production Environment
- Full functionality available with CDN access
- All features work as intended
- Performance is optimized for production use
